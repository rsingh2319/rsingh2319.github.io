    <h2>Background🐉</h2>
    <div id="description"><p style="color: #14a517">Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. <span style="font-size: 26px"> The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.</span>  The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p></div>

    <h2>Rules🙉</h2> 
            <p id="content"><p style="color: #14a5a4">The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,[5][6] and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.[7] A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as <span style="font-size: 26px">Hawk-Eye.</span></p>
